## Things I learned in this section

**<u>Nuances of document selectors:</u>** It's wonderful to get refreshed on things I don't use often - In this case, selectors for various elements in the HTML. During this session, I learned about querySelector and querySelectorAll. I had previously had experience with selectElementById and similar functions, but I think querySelector (and querySelectorAll) have some advantages in selecting elements quickly for adjustment. I can envision an use case for this in say, toggling dark/light mode without using CSS.

**<u>Personal notes:</u>**
This section was a straightforward simple dice game. The site requires the user to refresh the page to re-roll the dice. A button could be added to trigger the dice roll. At this time, the section of the content I am learning from did not cover this. Definitely come back later and implement this!
